    "# THE HESTON MODEL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heston model can be viewed as a nonlinear generalisation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the variance $v_t$ follows a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) diffusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dv_t = \\kappa (\\theta - v_t)\\, dt + \\eta \\sqrt{v_t}\\, dW_t^{(2)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Its structure resembles the mean-reverting OU process, except that the volatility coefficient $\\eta$ is not constant (as $\\sigma$ would be in an OU model), but proportional to $\\sqrt{v_t}$.  \n",
    "If we informally approximate $\\sqrt{v_t} \\approx 1$, the dynamics reduce to an OU process with additive noise:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dv_t \\approx \\kappa (\\theta - v_t)\\, dt + \\eta\\, dW_t.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The square-root term ensures $v_t \\ge 0$, although it does not always prevent the process from hitting zero. For this reason, one often imposes the Feller condition:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2\\kappa \\theta \\;\\ge\\; \\eta^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The full Heston model is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "dS_t = \\sqrt{v_t}\\, S_t\\, dW_t^{(1)} + (r-q) S_t\\, dt, \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "dv_t = \\eta \\sqrt{v_t}\\, dW_t^{(2)} + \\kappa(\\theta - v_t)\\, dt, \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "d\\langle W^{(1)}, W^{(2)}\\rangle_t = \\rho\\, dt.\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equation describes the asset-price dynamics;  \n",
    "The second governs the variance (a CIR process);  \n",
    "The third specifies the instantaneous correlation between the Brownian motions $W_t^{(1)}$ and $W_t^{(2)}$.  \n",
    "When $\\rho < 0$, the price tends to fall when volatility rises the well-known leverage effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial difference from the Black-Scholes model is that, with stochastic volatility, $\\ln S_t$ is no longer normally distributed. Conditional on a given path of $v_t$ it is Gaussian, but marginally it becomes a mixture of Gaussians, capable of producing fat tails and skewness observed in financial markets. The magnitude of this effect is controlled by $\\eta$, known as the *volatility of volatility*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the probability density of $\\ln S_t$ is not known in closed form, its characteristic function is. This enables Fourier-based pricing techniques (FFT, COS), as well as Monte Carlo simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the martingale approach, we arrive at the following multi-dimensional Heston option pricing PDE:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\n",
    "+\\frac{1}{2}vS^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2}\n",
    "+\\rho\\eta v S\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S \\partial v}\n",
    "+\\frac{1}{2}\\eta^2 v\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial v^2}\n",
    "+r S \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\n",
    "+\\kappa(\\theta - v)\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial v}\n",
    "-r V\n",
    "= 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with terminal condition\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(S,v,T) = (S-K)^+.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The rho parameter\n",
    "Rho defines the skew:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\rho < 0$  → negative skew (equity markets, leverage effect)\n",
    "- $\\rho ≈ 0$ → nearly symmetric smile\n",
    "- $\\rho > 0$ → positive skew (rare in equities)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The eta parameter\n",
    "Eta defines the smile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- small $\\eta$  → flat smile (close to Black–Scholes)\n",
    "- moderate $\\eta$  → visible smile curvature\n",
    "- large $\\eta$  → strong smile and heavy tails\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the parameters $\\kappa$ and $\\theta$ control the speed and level of mean reversion of volatility, while $\\eta$ governs the magnitude of volatility fluctuations and $\\rho$ determines the skew of the implied volatility surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greeks under the Heston Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of the model become clear when looking at Greeks, where stochastic volatility introduces richer behaviour:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delta**: \n",
    "    In Black-Scholes it depends only on price and constant volatility.  \n",
    "    In Heston it is influenced by the dynamics of $v_t$, producing a more flexible Delta that reacts better to strong market skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vega**: In Black-Scholes it is a monotonic function of $S$ and time to maturity.  \n",
    "    In Heston, volatility is not an exogenous input but a stochastic mean-reverting variable, so Vega reflects fluctuations in the variance itself (*volatility-of-volatility*).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gamma**: Black-Scholes provides simple closed-form expressions, but they can be rigid.  \n",
    "    Under Heston, sensitivities arise from a more complex pricing structure and better capture the curvature of smile and skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its strengths, the model is not perfect: it can reproduce smile and skew effects, but not uniformly across maturities, and it often struggles with very steep short-term skews."
